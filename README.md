Important Mathematical Proof Formula for sequence of numbers for algorithms:

Let

S = 1 + 2 + 3 + + 4 + … + (n−1) + n -----> eq_1

Write it backwards:

S = n + (n−1) + (n−2) + (n−3) + … + 2 + 1 ------> eq_2

Add the two equations eq_1 & eq_2 , term by term; each term is n+1, so

2S = (n+1) + (n+1) + … + (n+1) = n(n+1)

from above equation we note that we have n+1 terms n times

Divide by 2:

S = n(n+1)/2

This proof has been done by Carl Friedrich Gauss when he was in elementary school.
